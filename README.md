# ApocPhyloTree
ApocynaceaePhyloTree is a collaborative repository that helps to create phylogenetic big trees (here, a model for Apocynaceae|Gentianales). We curated resources for target capture and Sanger data sequences. Whether you're an experienced phylogeneticist or a newcomer, our centralised hub streamlines efforts in building comprehensive phylogenetic frameworks.
